# Assignment 01

### Summary
In this assignment you will flex your JSON manipulation muscles and build some souped up functions. 
After this assignment you should feel comfortable working in JSON and creating functions.

### Requirements
Use the included index.html and megaJSON.js file to complete the assignment.
1. Create a stringified JSON object.
2. Create a function called megaParse with the following spec:
    1. Takes one parameter, a string
    2. Parses the given string into a javascript object using JSON.parse()
    3. Prints to the console the following information (use console.log()):
        1. Number of properties
        2. Each property with it's value in sentence form (ie. "The name property has the value of rock")
    4. Finally, it returns the parsed javascript object.
3. Below all that use megaParse on your stringified object and ensure the results print out to the console.

Note: The format of the printed output is up to you, just make sure you cover both requirements.
